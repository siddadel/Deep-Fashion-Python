"# Deep-Fashion-Python" 

## Started in Java
We tried to see if VGG16 can immitate the mind of a shopper. The experiment is a bit too cumbersoom in Java. So we now move to Python.

Java is just to cumbersome for such experimentation.  It's a bit inconvenient. The community support (stackoverlow, medium), tools (scikitlearn, matplotlib, numpy) and infrastructure (aws, floydhub) are quite limited. It makes more sense to do this in Python. On Jupyter Notebook.

Let's try this in Python. We can deploy an enterprise level system in Java later.
